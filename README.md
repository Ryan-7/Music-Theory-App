# Popular-Chords


This app is written using the Object Literal design pattern and purposely uses pure JavaScript - no jQuery or JS frameworks.

A web app that helps users quickly and easily find all of the notes and chords in any given Major key.

I created this app for the use of my friends and I to aid in learning musical theory and improvisation.
