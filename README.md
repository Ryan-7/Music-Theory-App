# Popular-Chords


This app is written using the Object Literal design pattern and purposely uses pure JavaScript - no jQuery or JS frameworks.

A web app that helps users quickly and easily find all of the notes and chords in any given Major key.

The second problem this app aims to solve is helping musicians easily locate which notes will sound best over any given key while improvising.
